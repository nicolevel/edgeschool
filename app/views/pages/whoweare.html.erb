        <h1>Our Philosophy</h1>
        <h4>Edge Schools was founded in 2006 on the sound belief that an individualâ€™s growth and ability to change is hardly ever a mere factor of chance. It is often the result of forces working together diligently to translate learning into action.</h4>

        <h4>We believe in the power of good leadership and its ability to transform schools, organizations and whole communities.</h4>
        <br>
        <h4>We seek to develop and disseminate an entirely new paradigm and practice of collaboration with our clients, by working towards the common goal of developing leaders and facilitating societal wellbeing. </h4>
